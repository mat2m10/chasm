# chasm

**CHASM** (Correction and Heritability-Aware Simulation Model) is a simulation toolkit for generating and analyzing genotype-phenotype data under complex population structure, environmental influences, and heritability frameworks. It is designed for researchers exploring methodological biases in GWAS, burden testing, and rare variant inference under structured populations.

## ✨ Features

- 🧬 Simulation of admixed genotype data with customizable allele frequencies  
- 🌿 Modeling environmental covariates and gene-environment interactions  
- 🧪 Correction pipelines using ancestry factors and dimensionality reduction (UMAP, PCA, HDBSCAN)  
- 📊 Visualization of allele sharing, association statistics, and burden test results  
- 🔁 Integration with R-based coalescent models and rare variant association simulations
